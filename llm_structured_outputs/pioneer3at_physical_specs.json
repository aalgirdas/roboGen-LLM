    "1. Model the main chassis as a rectangular aluminum shell (1.6 mm wall thickness) with overall dimensions of 508 mm (length) x 381 mm (width) x 277 mm (height).",
    "2. Include internal compartments for battery housing (accessible through a hinged, latched panel on one side).",
    "3. Design four wheel assemblies with reinforced pneumatic tires (diameter ~222 mm). Position them symmetrically on both sides of the chassis for skid-steer operation.",
    "4. Add four DC motors, one per wheel, directly coupled to the wheel hubs to enable independent drive control.",
    "5. Integrate the control panel on the top or front surface â€” include labeled cutouts for power indicator, battery indicators, AUX switches, reset button, and motor enable pushbutton.",
    "6. Mount the internal microcontroller board (ARCOS system) centrally within the chassis. Include access points for power and communication ports (serial, USB, etc.).",
    "7. Add space and mounting points for optional accessories such as sonar arrays, laser range finders, cameras, GPS, and robotic arm modules.",
    "8. Apply powder-coated aluminum finish to the exterior; tires in black rubber, hub mounts in metallic gray.",
    "9. Assemble components ensuring easy disassembly for hot-swappable battery access and maintenance."
