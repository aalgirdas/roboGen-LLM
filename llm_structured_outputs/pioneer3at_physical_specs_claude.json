    "1. BASE CHASSIS: Create a rectangular aluminum chassis measuring 508mm (L) × 497mm (W) × 277mm (H) using 1.6mm thick aluminum sheet. Apply powder-coating finish. The chassis should be designed as a hollow box structure to house internal components.",
    "2. BATTERY COMPARTMENT: Design a hinged latched access panel on the chassis to accommodate up to 3 lead-acid batteries (7.2 Ah each). The panel must allow hot-swapping capability. Position for easy access while maintaining structural integrity.",
    "3. WHEEL AND MOTOR ASSEMBLY: Position four independent drive motors in a four-corner configuration for skid-steer operation. The wheelbase and track width should be calculated to achieve a swing radius of 340mm (34cm). Mount reinforced pneumatic tires on each wheel hub.",
    "4. DRIVE SYSTEM: Implement skid-steering mechanism with four-motor drive (one per wheel). Design for 0cm turn radius capability (turn in place). System must support maximum forward/backward speed of 0.7 m/s and rotation speed of 140°/s.",
    "5. WHEEL ENCODERS: Install rotary encoders on each of the four wheel assemblies for odometry and motion feedback. Integrate encoder wiring to microcontroller system.",
    "6. GROUND CLEARANCE: Design chassis height to provide capability for: 10cm maximum traversable step height, 15cm maximum traversable gap, and 35% maximum grade.",
    "7. MICROCONTROLLER MOUNTING: Install microcontroller board with ARCOS firmware internally. Ensure access to: 32 digital inputs, 8 digital outputs, 7 analog inputs, and 3 serial expansion ports. Route connections appropriately.",
    "8. POWER DISTRIBUTION: Integrate power management system supporting: 5V @ 1.5A switched supply, 12V @ 2.5A switched supply. Install direct plug-in charging port accessible from exterior.",
    "9. CONTROL PANEL: Mount user control panel on accessible exterior surface including: MIDI programmable piezo buzzer, main power indicator LED, battery charge indicator, 2 AUX power switches, system reset button, and motor enable pushbutton.",
    "10. EMERGENCY STOP: Install emergency stop switch in prominent, easily accessible location on the chassis exterior for immediate motor cutoff capability.",
    "11. ACCESSORY MOUNTING PROVISIONS: Design mounting points and structural support for optional accessories including: laser range finders, cameras, SONAR arrays, robotic arms, gyroscope, bumper arrays, and GPS units. Ensure compatibility with PC/104+ slots.",
    "12. CABLE MANAGEMENT: Create internal cable routing channels to organize power, signal, and data connections between batteries, motors, encoders, microcontroller, and external ports.",
    "13. WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION: Balance component placement to achieve 12kg total robot weight while maintaining stability. Design for payload capacity of 12kg on tile/floor, 10kg on grass/dirt, and 5kg on asphalt.",
    "14. PROTECTIVE FEATURES: Ensure construction is rugged and durable with consideration for: minor bumping, jarring, small gaps, and multi-terrain operation (asphalt, flooring, sand, dirt).",
    "15. FINAL ASSEMBLY: Integrate all subsystems, verify all connections, and ensure hinged panels operate smoothly for battery access. Test skid-steer functionality and verify turn radius performance."
