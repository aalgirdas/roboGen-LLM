    "Begin by creating the main body/chassis component. It is fabricated from 1.6 mm powder-coated aluminum. The overall footprint is approximately 497 mm (depth) by 508 mm (width). The overall height of the assembly is 277 mm. Model the body in a red color.",
    "Model a separate top plate, colored grey/silver, to fit onto the main body. Include cutouts for an emergency stop switch and other user controls as seen in the image on page 1.",
    "Establish the mounting points for the four wheels based on the diagram on page 2. The wheel axles are spaced 268 mm apart across the width and 381 mm apart along the length of the robot, centered on the chassis.",
    "Model a single wheel assembly with a total diameter of 222 mm. The tire is a black reinforced pneumatic type, and the hub is silver/grey.",
    "Create an assembly and place the main chassis. Mate four instances of the wheel assembly to the previously defined axle mounting points.",
    "Design an internal compartment to house up to three lead-acid batteries. The design must include a hinged, latched access panel to allow for hot-swapping, as specified in the documentation.",
    "The final model is a skid-steer platform, meaning there are no steering joints for the wheels. The robot is driven by four independent motors, one for each wheel.",
    "Set the mass properties of the final assembly to a total of 12 kg."
