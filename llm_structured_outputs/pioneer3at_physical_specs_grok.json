    "Start by modeling the main body as a rectangular chassis using 1.6 mm thick aluminum sheet, powder-coated red, with overall dimensions approximately 508 mm length, 381 mm width (inner), and 277 mm height; include a flat top platform and sides.",
    "Add four wheel assemblies: model reinforced pneumatic tires (black, diameter 222 mm) mounted on yellow rims; position two wheels on each side in a skid-steer configuration with wheelbase approximately 268 mm (front to rear) and track width 381 mm (inner), extending to overall width of 497 mm.",
    "Incorporate front and rear overhangs of approximately 120 mm each based on overall length.",
    "Include a hinged latched access panel on the body for battery compartment, supporting up to three lead-acid batteries.",
    "Add mounting points for accessories such as emergency stop switch, wheel encoders, and microcontroller; encoders attach to wheels, microcontroller inside body.",
    "Model four motors for skid-steer drive, attached internally to drive the wheels directly (no joints, fixed axles).",
    "Include user control panel on the body with piezo buzzer, indicators, switches, reset, and motor enable button.",
    "Ensure the model accounts for swing radius of 340 mm and turn radius of 0 cm for skid-steer dynamics.",
    "Assemble by attaching wheel-motor assemblies to the body sides, then add batteries internally, control panel on top/rear, and any basic accessories like e-stop switch on top.",
    "Use metric units; replicate geometric features from the diagram on page 2, such as rounded edges if visible, and rugged construction for all-terrain use."
